# No module needed

# first We creating function to enter number

x=input("Enter your first number: ")

y=input("Enter your second number: ")

# Wait we input string valuable in python
# we need to convert it to integer

addition=int(x)+int(y)

# when we add like this addition=(x)+(y) and x=1 and y=2
